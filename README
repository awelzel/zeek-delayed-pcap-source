DelayedPcapSource
=================================

A packet source that can delay packets or mangle their timestamps.

This is just a hacked up Zeek's Pcap Source.

Let packet timestamps be 6 seconds in the past:

    zeek -C -i  delayedpcap::lo -f 'port 80' Zeek::DelayedPcapSource::move_interval=-6.0sec;


Delay packet release by 6 seconds (this currently busy polls):

    zeek -C -i  delayedpcap::lo -f 'port 80' Zeek::DelayedPcapSource::delay=6.0sec;
